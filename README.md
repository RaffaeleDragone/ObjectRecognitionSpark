# ObjectRecognitionSpark
Object recognition is an artificial vision technique for identifying objects in images or videos and is a key output for Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms.

In this project, through the use of Machine learning techniques with Artificial Neural Networks and the use of ApacheSpark to perform the computation in parallel efficiently and on a cluster composed of many nodes, every single object present at the internal of about 50TB of data.

The performance of the parallel versus sequential version was also compared.
